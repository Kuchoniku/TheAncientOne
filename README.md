Adds The Ancient One as a new character!
Includes cards, relics, and potions with full art made by me.
Mechanics:
* Lock: Locked cards are unplayable until they are Unlocked by other cards/effects. Some cards start off Locked and return to being locked after being played.
* Beams: Beams are a type of card which can synergize with each other, and some automatically play Autobeams (0 cost 2(3) damage to a random enemy).
* Turn Count: Some cards have effects that are better or worse when the turn count is higher. Additionally, Bleed is a poison like status effect which gains damage as the turn count increases.
